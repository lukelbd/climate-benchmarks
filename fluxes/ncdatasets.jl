# Julia script for getting fluxes
# Recommendation for building module this way copes from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50627721/4970632
# Beginner notes:
#   * Type '?' in REPL to get help info
#   * Type ';' to issue shell commands
#   * Use 'apropos("string")' to search for func names
#   * Use ']' for package management tools
#   * Use 'splat' operator <iterable>... inside a function to expand
#     like in *args.
#   * Also use keys() or values() to iterate over the mappable
#   * In julia, function names ending in '!' modify their arguments,
#     sort of like NCL commands vs. functions
# More advanced notes:
#   * To update modules, use 'using Revise' and only *import* local modules
#     instead of calling 'using'. See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50816280/4970632
#   * To re-install packages after you change underlying OS libraries
#     e.g. NetCDF, just use Pkg.build("name")
#   * For scoping inside for/do loops inside a function, see this
#     answer: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/22659#issuecomment-312525833
#     Also see: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/repl-and-for-loops-scope-behavior-change/13514
#   * You can overwrite "global" variables without "global" keyword
#     when declared inside a function, but not in a script or the REPL!!!
#     Also see: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/28789
# Running efficiently from shell:
#   * Main source of suggestions came from here:
#     https://stackoverflow.com/a/50996444/4970632
#   * Tried the pipeline approach but then can't wait for julia commands
#     See: https://stackoverflow.com/q/48510815/4970632
#   * Alternative was to build system image file but this also
#     seemed to fail: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/28557
# For Julia REPL info see: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/The_REPL#Help_and_searching_for_help
# Example random number generation (after 'using Random')
#   a = rand(Float32, 5, 3)
#   a = zeros(5, 3)
#   rand!(a)  # populates array
# NOTE: To re-install packages after you change underlying OS libraries use Pkg.build("name")
